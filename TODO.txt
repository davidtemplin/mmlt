* Define Material and Texture interface
* Define scene file format
* Write parser for scene files
* Write config parser for command-line arguments
* Change Object from trait to struct.
  -- Contains a material, shape, etc.
  -- Rename to Primitive?
* Use Geometry abstraction?
  -- Contains position, direction, normal, 2D parameterization, etc.
  -- Interactions contain a Geometry instance, plus the underlying Object, Camera, Light, etc.
* Implement ConstantTexture
* Implement MatteMaterial
* Implement Sphere shape
* Implement Parallelogram (or Rectangle?) shape
* Implement image filters

The initial test scene will use constant textures, matte materials, rectangles, area lights, pinhole camera, one sphere.
